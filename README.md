# A Map I made for my internship at Randell's Island.

### This is a visualization of program's efforts and projects called, "Park-as-a-Lab", which can be found <a href="https://randallsisland.org/things-to-see-do/park-as-lab/">here</a>.

### The project was built using javascript, and the mapbox gl js api. Npm was also used for package management. The map can be used by inserting your own mapbox access token in line 135.
