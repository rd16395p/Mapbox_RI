# A Map I made for my internship at Randel's Island.

### This is a visualization of the at the time program called "Park as a Lab", which can be found <a href="https://randallsisland.org/things-to-see-do/park-as-lab/">here</a>.

### This is built using javascript, and the mapbox gl js api. Npm was also used for package management. This can be used by inserting your own mapbox access token in line 135.
